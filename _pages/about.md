About me
----

I am a PhD candidate at Southern Methodist University. My work is focused on understanding multiscale long-time wave propagation equations for application in fluid dynamics, reduced order modeling for large rocket problems, and parallel implementations of those algorithms on our new SuperPOD. Model discovery using data-driven methods is also of interest to me.
