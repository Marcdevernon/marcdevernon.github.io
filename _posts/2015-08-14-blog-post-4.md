I consider the wave equation as presented by Daniel Appel$\ddot{o}$, Thomas Hagstrom, Qi Wang and Lu Zhang, (Hagstrom et al.) in their paper, "An Energy-based discontinuous Galerkin Method for Semilinear wave equations."

I will show the engergy DG scheme for thier paper applied to $f(u) = sin(u).$ Later we will look at perturbing the equations to simulate turbulence as a basis for understanding reduced order models based on simulated data. The starting equation is: 
$$
u_{tt} -{\nu}u_txx = c^{2}\Delta u + sin(u)
$$
