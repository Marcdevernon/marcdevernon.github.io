I write up my understanding of the LOD method presented in Peterseim and Malqvist's book, "Numerical Homogenization by Localized Orthogonal Decomposition" published by SIAM in 2021

Headings are cool
======

Here is an inline LaTeX equation: $E = mc^2$

Here is a block LaTeX equation:

$$
E = \frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
$$

You can have many headings
======

Aren't headings cool?
