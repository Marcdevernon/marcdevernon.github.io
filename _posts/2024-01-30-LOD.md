I write up my understanding of the LOD method presented in Peterseim and Malqvist's book, "Numerical Homogenization by Localized Orthogonal Decomposition" published by SIAM in 2021

Chapter 2

Chapter 2.1

Here is an inline LaTeX equation: $E = mc^2$

Here is a block LaTeX equation:

$$
E = \frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
$$

% \f is defined as #1f(#2) using the macro
\f\relax{x} = \int_{-\infty}^\infty
    \f\hat\xi\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}
    \,d\xi

You can have many headings

Aren't headings cool?
