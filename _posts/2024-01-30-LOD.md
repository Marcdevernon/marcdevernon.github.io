I write up my understanding of the LOD method presented in Peterseim and Malqvist's book, "Numerical Homogenization by Localized Orthogonal Decomposition" published by SIAM in 2021

The authors provide an initial introduction to why homogenization is necessary for problems with fine-scale and coarse-scale spatial discretization. They do this by considering a one-dimensional diffusion problem on $\Omega :=(0,1)$

$$\frac{d}{dx}(A_{\epsilon}(x)\frac{d}{dx}u_{\epsilon}(x)) = f(x) in \Omega,\\u_{\epsilon}(1)=0$$

$u_{\epsilon}$ is positive, $\epsilon>0$ is a small number. The unique solution, $u_{\epsilon}$ is located in the Sobolev space $V:=H_{0}^{1}$. It has a variational formulation: 

$$
\int_{\Omega} A_{\epsilon}u_{\epsilon}'v' \, dx = \int_{\Omega} fv \, dx\ for\ all\ v \in V.
$$

Here the forcing is $f\colonequals 1$ and $A_{\epsilon}(x) \colonequals (2+cos(2\pi\frac{x}{\epsilon}))^{-1}$.
